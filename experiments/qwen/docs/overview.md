# Qwen experiment

`experiments.qwen` contains bounded Qwen repository-read experiments.

The llama.cpp transport adapter lives in
`devtools.models.interaction.providers` as `LlamaCppInteraction`. It is
configured with endpoint, served model name, and source identity; it is not
Qwen-specific.

This repository artifact is intentionally outside the installable `devtools`
framework API. `read_experiment.py` recognizes one exact read proposal,
permits only `read_repository_file`, uses the existing `ToolRunner` and
`ReadRepositoryFileTool`, then supplies ordered bounded result projections
through controller-authored SYSTEM Messages. It permits only two reads before
requiring a final plain-text answer. It is not generic orchestration,
authorization, Context compilation, or Action infrastructure.

The package does not implement streaming, native tool calls, usage accounting,
provider-neutral model semantics, provider continuation, generic proposals,
or a coding worker.

`two_action_read_only_experiment.py` is a separate bounded successor probe. It
permits two concrete read-only operations—non-recursive directory listing and
text-file reading—within an explicitly configured local action cap (two by
default). Its controller remains experiment-local: it uses explicit dispatch,
action-specific path materialization, bounded projections, and stateless SYSTEM
reconstruction.

Its deterministic root-navigation fixture starts at repository-relative `.`
without a target path or directory hint, descends through repeated direct
listings, and reads a discovered Python source file. This is repository fact
acquisition and controller-directed navigation, not reusable Context,
repository discovery/indexing, generic Action, authorization, orchestration,
or acceptance infrastructure.
