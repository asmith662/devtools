# Architecture

`devtools` is organized by responsibility. Package-local documentation defines
exact APIs; [the taxonomy](architecture/taxonomy.md) defines semantic terms.
This document records the current cross-package ownership and dependency rules.

## Domains

```text
core/           foundational values and transformations
resources/      reusable filesystem and process access
models/         model interaction, serving, and benchmarks
agents/         durable conversation and external agent integrations
context/        reserved for relevance selection and compilation
tools/          typed controlled capability boundaries
execution/      narrow Runtime and specialized InteractionAttempt lifecycle
orchestration/  reserved workflow coordination
governance/     reserved authority and policy responsibility
observability/  Evidence and diagnostic observation
persistence/    durable representation storage and restoration
evaluation/     reserved reusable evaluation responsibility
```

Sparse domains are intentional. Their presence does not authorize speculative
APIs.

## Current boundaries

```text
ConversationMessage
    -> Prompt
        -> ModelInteraction
            -> ModelResponse
                -> materialized ConversationMessage
```

`Runtime` coordinates that one-model exchange for one `Conversation`. It owns
neither agent loops nor orchestration. With an execution observer configured,
it creates and terminalizes a specialized `InteractionAttempt`. Execution does
not depend on observability. `ExecutionInspector` in observability observes
attempt facts, constructs immutable terminal Evidence, and optionally forwards
it to an EvidenceSink.

`CodexAgent` is an external Agent integration under `agents.integrations`; it
does not implement `ModelInteraction`. `LlamaCppInteraction` is a configurable
model provider under `models.interaction.providers`. Model serving makes an
endpoint available; model interaction communicates with it.

Resources are not Tools. Resources provide reusable lower-level access;
Tools adapt bounded typed capabilities for controlled invocation. Tool
validation is not authorization.

Persistence stores and restores Conversation representations. It keeps the
established durable JSON and SQLite wire/schema names where compatibility
requires them; storage does not own conversation semantics.

## Dependency direction

```text
core <- resources <- models
core <- resources <- tools
models, tools, resources <- agents
models, agents <- execution
execution <- observability
agents <- persistence
experiments -> devtools
devtools -/> experiments
```

The diagram permits only dependencies justified by a concrete package API.
Notably, core does not depend upward, model interaction does not depend on
Codex, execution does not depend on observability, and Runtime does not own
orchestration.

## Principles

- Model is not Agent; ModelResponse is not AgentResult.
- Conversation is not Run; generic Run, Step, and Attempt remain future work.
- Context is not Memory or Persistence.
- Evidence is not Trace, Telemetry, or present authority.
- Model proposal, Tool visibility, and Tool validation are not authorization.
- Cancellation is not rollback, and communication failure does not prove an
  external effect did not occur.
