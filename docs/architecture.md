# Architecture

`devtools` is organized by responsibility. Package-local documentation defines
exact APIs; [the taxonomy](architecture/taxonomy.md) defines semantic terms.
This document records the current cross-package ownership and dependency rules.
Accepted future changes are recorded separately in
[architecture decisions](architecture/decisions/); they do not redefine an
unimplemented API as current behavior.

## Domains

```text
core/           foundational values and transformations
resources/      reusable filesystem and process access
models/         model interaction, serving, and benchmarks
agents/         durable conversation and external agent integrations
context/        future repository intelligence and purpose-relative Context
tools/          typed controlled capability boundaries
execution/      narrow Runtime and specialized InteractionAttempt lifecycle
orchestration/  reserved workflow coordination
governance/     reserved authority and policy responsibility
observability/  Evidence and diagnostic observation
persistence/    durable representation storage and restoration
evaluation/     reserved reusable evaluation responsibility
```

Sparse domains are intentional. Their presence does not authorize speculative
APIs.

## Current boundaries

```text
ConversationMessage
    -> Prompt
        -> ModelInteraction
            -> ModelResponse
                -> materialized ConversationMessage
```

`Runtime` coordinates that one-model exchange for one `Conversation`. It owns
neither agent loops nor orchestration. With an execution observer configured,
it creates and terminalizes a specialized `InteractionAttempt`. Execution does
not depend on observability. `ExecutionInspector` in observability observes
attempt facts, constructs immutable terminal Evidence, and optionally forwards
it to an EvidenceSink.

`CodexAgent` is an external Agent integration under `agents.integrations`; it
does not implement `ModelInteraction`. `LlamaCppInteraction` is a configurable
model provider under `models.interaction.providers`. Model serving makes an
endpoint available; model interaction communicates with it.

Resources are not Tools. Resources provide reusable lower-level access;
Tools adapt bounded typed capabilities for controlled invocation. Tool
validation is not authorization.

Persistence stores and restores Conversation representations. It keeps the
established durable JSON and SQLite wire/schema names where compatibility
requires them; storage does not own conversation semantics.

## Dependency direction

```text
core <- resources <- models
core <- resources <- tools
models, tools, resources <- agents
models, agents <- execution
execution <- observability
agents <- persistence
experiments -> devtools
devtools -/> experiments
```

The diagram permits only dependencies justified by a concrete package API.
Notably, core does not depend upward, model interaction does not depend on
Codex, execution does not depend on observability, and Runtime does not own
orchestration.

## Principles

- Model is not Agent; ModelResponse is not AgentResult.
- Conversation is not Run; generic Run, Step, and Attempt remain future work.
- Context is not Memory or Persistence.
- Evidence is not Trace, Telemetry, or present authority.
- Model proposal, Tool visibility, and Tool validation are not authorization.
- Cancellation is not rollback, and communication failure does not prove an
  external effect did not occur.

## Accepted ModelInteraction boundary

[ADR-0001](architecture/decisions/ADR-0001-cohesive-model-interaction-boundary.md)
approves a cohesive future ModelInteraction boundary: immutable semantic
requests and settings, typed provider-only request extensions, normalized
model-native Tool calls, capture-controlled model interaction Evidence, and
serving-profile provenance. Its phased implementation preserves that models
never execute Tools, Tools do not depend on model providers, Runtime remains
narrow, and raw provider exchange data stays outside `ModelResponse`.

All three ADR-0001 phases are implemented; package documentation and source
remain authoritative for exact current APIs.

## Accepted repository-intelligence semantics

[ADR-0002](architecture/decisions/ADR-0002-repository-intelligence-identity-and-derivation.md)
accepts future semantic architecture for Repository identity, content-derived
RepositorySnapshots, derivation-aware DerivedKnowledge, and distinct derivation
and repository-relationship graph families. It also preserves Context as
purpose-relative selection and disclosure rather than repository truth.

This architecture does not imply a current `context` implementation. Filesystem
Resources remain access mechanisms, not Repository identity. Retrieval,
ranking, Context compilation, progressive disclosure, storage, and evaluation
remain unimplemented future responsibilities; Runtime remains narrow and model
requests remain non-authoritative.

## Accepted retrieval and ranking semantics

[ADR-0003](architecture/decisions/ADR-0003-information-need-retrieval-evidence-and-ranking.md)
accepts InformationNeed, bounded retrieval planning/applications,
ContextCandidate, provenance-bearing RelevanceEvidence, and ranking semantics.
It preserves retrieval as multi-strategy evidence discovery; ranking as evidence
interpretation; and Context selection/compilation as a later, distinct concern.
It also preserves concurrent dependency-aware retrieval, staged expansion,
progressive disclosure, and future evaluation pressure without assigning them
to Runtime, Tool execution, authorization, or an Agent loop.

See [documentation_map.md](documentation_map.md) for current package
documentation, [taxonomy.md](architecture/taxonomy.md) for definitions, and
[ADR-0001](architecture/decisions/ADR-0001-cohesive-model-interaction-boundary.md)
for the approved future boundary.
